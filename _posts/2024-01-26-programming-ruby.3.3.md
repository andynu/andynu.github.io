I've just received my copy of Programming Ruby 3.3. The original edition of
this book is how I first learned ruby years ago. I've been following along with
all the releases since then, but I wonder if there are any dusty corners that
have escaped my notice. This is a language I enjoy using, so I'm pleased to
take this occasion to brush up on it.
